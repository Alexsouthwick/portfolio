		<p> I am a freshman at Barnard College intending to major in Computer Science. I am passionate about female leadership centered education and closing the gender gap within the technology industry. I have experience teaching kids, from toddlers to teenagers, and believe that education based on communication and teamwork builds life-long skills. I am interested in the intersection of technology and education. </p>
